# Sierpinski Triangle
This scripts is a Pygame implementation of the Chaos Game to draw a Sierpinski Triangle.

### Rules

* Start with a big triangle
* Find the middle of each side of the big triangle
* Make a new small triangle and connect these three middle points to form a smaller triangle inside the big triangle. Then, pretend to erase the small triangle in the center.
* Repeat the magic, you now have three triangles left. Do the same thing with each oneâ€”find the middle of their sides, draw a small triangle, and erase it.
